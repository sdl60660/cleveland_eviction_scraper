# Cleveland Eviction Scraper
Scrapes eviction data from the Cleveland Municipal Courts site on evictions using Selenium. The crawler class lives in the municourts.py file and several supporting scripts use it to pull down data by date range or to update the existing data.

This visualization project is based on the data, after it has been geocoded and matched with neighborhood/demographic data from Zillow/the census: https://cleveland-evictions.herokuapp.com/
